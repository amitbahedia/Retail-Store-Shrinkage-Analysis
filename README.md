üîç Key Insights & Patterns

‚Ä¢	Regional Concentration: Delhi, Maharashtra, and Gujarat collectively account for over 65% of total shrinkage volume

‚Ä¢	Persistent Store-Level Issues: Specific stores consistently reported higher-than-average shrinkage, indicating possible systemic or process-related challenges

‚Ä¢	Disproportionate Product Loss: Certain low-sales SKUs still generated significant shrinkage value‚Äîhighlighting inefficiencies in product handling and control


Strategic Recommendations

1.	Initiate Targeted Audits: Begin internal reviews at Store 11, Store 12, and Store 6, where shrinkage values are highest
2.	Strengthen Physical Controls: Focus efforts on Electronics and Home Decor, which exhibit higher loss rates
3. Improve Forecasting & Replenishment: Adjust inventory policies to prevent overstocking of loss-prone items
4. Monitor Seasonal Variability: Shrinkage rates are elevated in Q1 (Jan‚ÄìMar)‚Äîintroduce special procedures during these months
5. Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Regularly track Shrinkage Rate (%) and Efficiency Score to support continuous monitoring and accountability

 Conclusion
 
This six-month analysis provides clear visibility into RetailHeight‚Äôs inventory shrinkage landscape, uncovering both macro-level trends and store-specific anomalies. With a total shrinkage value of $21 million, the insights enable the organization to implement focused mitigation strategies, improve operational efficiency, and significantly reduce preventable losses in the second half of 2024.
